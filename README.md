# Corona-Virus-Pandemic
The "Covid-19 Impact Analysis" project uses Python's Dash to make an interactive dashboard. It shows Covid-19 cases and supplies like masks and oxygen across Indian states, making the data easy to understand.
The project uses numpy and pandas for data analysis, plotly for interactive plots, and dash for web development, including layout components and handling callbacks.
This project not only enhances skills in data analysis and web development but also serves as a practical application of data analytics and science in addressing real-world challenges.
