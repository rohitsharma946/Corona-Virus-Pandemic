# Corona-Virus-Pandemic
The "Covid-19 Impact Analysis" project uses Python's Dash library web deployment to create an interactive dashboard.
This dashboard visually represents key Covid-19 metrics such as total cases, active cases, recovered cases, and total deaths according to different states of India. 
It also analyzes the availability of essential items like masks, sanitizers, and oxygen. The goal is to make complex pandemic data easy to understand through interactive visuals.
